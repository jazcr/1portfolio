## Description

This is a very early-stage of my portfolio. On this page, there are a few small details about me, a couple of projects I have completed so far, and some links to contact me.
(Github Pages link to my second project, "Vision Board", was not loading correctly so the repo link was included instead)

I was able to make the page responsive by adding some Media Queries to the end of my CSS. I was also able to make the images change colors when hovered over.
